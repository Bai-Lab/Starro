# Starro

Starro: a uniform framework of cell segmentation on spatially resolved transcriptomes



# Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Bai-Lab/Starro.git
```

# Usage

Starro is integrated and easier to use in our comprehensive spatial transcriptomics analytic framework [Spateo](https://github.com/aristoteleo/spateo-release), [Tutorial](https://spateo-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/notebooks/cell_segmentation.html).  A brief **tutorial** [(vignette)](https://github.com/Bai-Lab/Starro/blob/main/notebooks/starro_rna_seg_tutorial.ipynb) is included in the package.
